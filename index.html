        <p>The ideal image of women constantly changes across different time and places. 
            Cosmetics have played a critical role in shaping women’s identity throughout the history. 
        <br> <br> <br>Although nowadays using cometics is sometimes condemned as a source of women’s oppression, 
        a century ago, it embodied women's self-expression and emancipation. The cosmetic industry 
        opened up opportunities for women to achieve their ambitions, build communities and empower other women.
        <br> <br> <br> By reflecting on the cosmetics history, at times beautiful and at times ugly, 
        the beauty culture may push forward to more inclusivity, diversity and relevance for a new era.

            <p>For 19th-century Americans, the act of beautifying was frowned upon as 
                it was seen as immoral and unrespectable. The “painted woman” who put on makeup provoked 
                disgust and censure from the virtuous. Only stage actress and prostitutes, 
                as it was generally agreed, would enhance their face with artifice.

            <p><br>
                <br>In contrast, a lady of a higher social standing would avoid using visible makeup and pursue a “natural” pale look instead.
                A pale complexion was preferred as it would indicate that a woman did not have to work outside, and was thus of higher status. 
                At that time, they would even use accessories like gloves and umbrellas to help protect them from the sunshine.

                <br>Apart from covering their skin with clothes, <b>Victorian ladies</b> also secretly used some cosmetics that would enhance their pale look.
                Many cosmetic products then were aimed at achieving as pale a complexion as possible. 
                Cold cream, vanishing cream, lotion, etc. became a staple in the beauty rituals of 
                Victorian women.

                an emblem of women’s emancipation, and incorporated its use into the 1912 New York Suffragette Rally. Thereafter, 
                suffragists wore a particularly noticeable shade of red lip rouge as part of the standard rally procedure.

                Madam C. J. Walker (1867-1919) was “the first black woman millionaire in America” and made her fortune 
                thanks to her homemade line of hair care products for black women. Born Sarah Breedlove to parents who 
                had been slaves, she was inspired to create her hair products after an experience with hair loss, which 
                led to the creation of the “Walker system” of hair care.

                <br>
                <br>A talented entrepreneur with a knack for self-promotion, Walker built a business empire, at first 
                selling products directly to black women, then employing “beauty culturalists” to hand-sell her wares. 
                The self-made millionaire used her fortune to fund scholarships for women at the Tuskegee Institute and donated 
                large parts of her wealth to the NAACP, the black YMCA and other charities.<br><br></p>

                not straightening, in their beauty systems. Building their beauty empire, they created thousands of job 
                opportunities for black women and continuously gave back to the community<br><br><br><br></p>

                <br>to Disrupt Gender Norms

            <p>
                Drag is a gender-bending art form in which a person dresses in clothing and makeup meant to exaggerate a 
                specific gender identity, usually of the opposite sex.
                 <br><br>Drag has deep roots in Western culture, specifically in theatre when women weren’t permitted to 
                 perform on stage so men would play female roles. Drag performers were featured as far back as ancient Greece and carried on through Shakespearean times.

                <br>Cross-dressing and drag performances existed as an underground culture for much of the 20th century, 
                and the visibility of drag queens increased alongside that of LGBT communities in the late 1960s.   
            <br><br>The Harlem Renaissance (1920-1935) was particularly influential to this process. Through dance, drag queens showed how gender is a performance – 
            they pretended to put on makeup or “beat face”, style their hair, and put on extravagant clothes. <br><br></p>

            <p><br>
        
                <br>In Cristy’s (2017) interviews with drag queens to understand their gender performance, the participants mentioned they attained social and political 
                visibility through drag, as drag helped them reach a larger audience when attempting to express social and 
                political issues and norms. One mentioned that “drag is a political tool”.   
            </p>
            
            <p><br>The action of painting and applying makeup has been a critical way for drag performers to shape their subculture, and with that, challenge geneder roles. 
            Being queer disrupts heteronormative expectations, and drag is an extension of this disruption.   <br>

        <h1>About the project</h1>
        <hr size=".5" width="60%" color="white"> 
        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> <br> This is a capstone project for Huan's master study in Digital Media at Georgia Tech.
            By bringing back the rich history of cosmetics with a digital museum experience, this project hopes to uncover the power of cosmetics as a political tool to challenge some mainstream views.
            <br> <br>The main argument was based on Kathy Peiss's book <i>Hope in a Jar: The Making of America’s Beauty Culture</i>. Therefore, this project 
            also functions as a multimedia remediation for the reading experience to capture and share history in an engaging and informative way.
